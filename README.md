# Social Engineering Attack - # Facebook Phishing with SEToolkit


# Segment 1: What is Social Engineering?
# Definition: #

Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into revealing confidential information. Instead of hacking systems, attackers hack people by exploiting human emotions like trust, fear, or urgency.

# Common Social Engineering Attacks:
Phishing: Fake websites or emails tricking users into entering credentials.
Pretexting: Creating a false scenario to extract sensitive data.
Baiting: Offering free software or downloads loaded with malware.
Tailgating: Physically following someone into restricted areas.

# Segment 3: Preventing Phishing Attacks

Check URLs carefully – Always verify the website before entering credentials.
Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) – Even if credentials are stolen, MFA adds a security layer.
Be cautious with emails and messages – Avoid clicking unknown links.
Use security software & browser extensions – Tools like Netcraft and NoScript can block phishing pages.

# Stay cyber-aware, and never fall for such traps!"
